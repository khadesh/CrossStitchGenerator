# CrossStitchGenerator

A program that takes images in a folder and spits out a cross stitch pattern for sizes 80x80 120x120 and 180x180 in the out directory. Sample image included.

Future Improvements:
* Grid splitting across multiple pages for larger patterns.
* Ability to set text on images in various locations / fonts.
* Better formated legends with color names and clearer labels.
* Better color mappings to standardized color kits.
* Adding headers to the generated PDFs.
